    We‚Äôre so excited to reach this milestone with the community, and this year we wanted to do something 
    truly special. The result: a festival that brings in-game and in-person experiences together in an 
    event so big it may not even fit in this blog post. We‚Äôve said before that we wanted to make Sky‚Äôs 
    5th birthday live up to the occasion, something that brings together the magic of an in-person event, 
    shared with a global community across the game. And that‚Äôs exactly what SkyFest does! For two full 
    weeks from July 12th through 26th PDT, the SkyFest 5th anniversary blends a community celebration 
    with real-life events that everyone can be part of, no matter where they are in the world.`,

     music to words, check with the Spirits to jam together in ensemble mode!`,
