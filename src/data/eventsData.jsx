     in the clouds‚Äînot unlike Sky children. Since his arrival to life on the ground, 
     he‚Äôs become an expert in how to make a cafe lively and inviting, and he‚Äôll be 
     in Aviary Village as part of a special three-week collaboration that welcomes
      Sky kids to the newest gathering place in the kingdom. Credit: ThatSkyGame Official Website`,

    but starting on May 27th, Spirits and Sky children alike will be called to aid the 
    river that brings life to the area when Days of Nature returns. For three weeks, 
    Shard Eruptions and the Darkness they bring threaten the health of Prairie Peaks‚Äô waters. 
    Spirits will be on hand to build a device that keeps the corruption from spreading 
    downstream, but it‚Äôs up to Sky kids to capture its pollution and stop it from 
    impacting the spaces around the river. Credit: ThatSkyGame Official Website`,
