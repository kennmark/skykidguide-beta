     in the clouds‚Äînot unlike Sky children. Since his arrival to life on the ground, 
     he‚Äôs become an expert in how to make a cafe lively and inviting, and he‚Äôll be 
     in Aviary Village as part of a special three-week collaboration that welcomes
      Sky kids to the newest gathering place in the kingdom. Credit: ThatSkyGame Official Website`,

    but starting on May 27th, Spirits and Sky children alike will be called to aid the 
    river that brings life to the area when Days of Nature returns. For three weeks, 
    Shard Eruptions and the Darkness they bring threaten the health of Prairie Peaks‚Äô waters. 
    Spirits will be on hand to build a device that keeps the corruption from spreading 
    downstream, but it‚Äôs up to Sky kids to capture its pollution and stop it from 
    impacting the spaces around the river. Credit: ThatSkyGame Official Website`,

    shining capes, and colorful Spirits will celebrate the diverse world we share. To join in, 
    talk with Spirits in Aviary Village or Home and they‚Äôll teleport you to a bright, spacious 
    area floating above the clouds above Daylight Prairie Village. There you‚Äôll find a rainbow 
    puzzle that grows each day. Complete that puzzle and you‚Äôll reveal a new Days of Color feature 
    that can satisfy your Sky kid‚Äôs need for speed. Don‚Äôt have what you need for the puzzle? Take a 
    dip in a magical geyser nearby that will add a special splash of color to your cape (and more)!`,

    We‚Äôre so excited to reach this milestone with the community, and this year we wanted to do something 
    truly special. The result: a festival that brings in-game and in-person experiences together in an 
    event so big it may not even fit in this blog post. We‚Äôve said before that we wanted to make Sky‚Äôs 
    5th birthday live up to the occasion, something that brings together the magic of an in-person event, 
    shared with a global community across the game. And that‚Äôs exactly what SkyFest does! For two full 
    weeks from July 12th through 26th PDT, the SkyFest 5th anniversary blends a community celebration 
    with real-life events that everyone can be part of, no matter where they are in the world.`,
