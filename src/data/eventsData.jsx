     in the clouds‚Äînot unlike Sky children. Since his arrival to life on the ground, 
     he‚Äôs become an expert in how to make a cafe lively and inviting, and he‚Äôll be 
     in Aviary Village as part of a special three-week collaboration that welcomes
      Sky kids to the newest gathering place in the kingdom.`,
